# Exploring-the-FEC-2016-Elections-Data
In this assignment I will be using a jupyter notebook written in python to explore the 2016 elections in the USA. The questions that I will try to answer are the following:

## Questions
* Identify the top 5 Political Action Committees (PACs), or rather, super-PACs, that supported each of the two presidential candidates, giving the amount of money raised and spent by each one of them.

* Identify the top 10 individual donors (i.e., persons) for each of the two presidential candidates and the amount they spent. In order to do that, you should know that donations are not always to a fundraising committee that can be directly linked to a candidate, but they can be due to other entities such as PACs.

* Investigate the chronological evolution of the contributions made to and the expenditures made by the campaigns.

* Identify the biggest recipients of campaign expenditures.

* Examine the geographical distribution, at the state level, of campaign expenditures. For each state, calculate the expenditures per voter. This will require that you find a source with the number of registered voters per state. Examine the situation for swing states.
